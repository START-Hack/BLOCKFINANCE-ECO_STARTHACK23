## Case Introduction:

Entrepreneurs and start-up companies looking to incorporate Bitcoin as a payment method for their clients, loans, employee payment, and fund raising can benefit from the START 2023 Hack-Case. Participants will work on challenges related to building their own Bitcoin infrastructure, including Bitcoin nodes, Bitcoin explorer, Bitcoin payment server, and Bitcoin wallets, using open-source tools and affordable hardware. By leveraging the power and security of Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and start-up companies can streamline their business operations and create a seamless payment experience for their customers, all while staying at the forefront of the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.

The Hack-Case challenge allows a maximum of 120 participants, who can form teams of three to compete.

### Problem

The problem we are solving with this is the lack of knowledge and resources for individuals and businesses to fully incorporate Bitcoin as a payment method and funding mechanism. Many people and companies are interested in utilizing Bitcoin, but may not know where to start or how to fully integrate it into their operations. By providing a hands-on Hack-Case that guides participants through the process of setting up their own Bitcoin infrastructure and company, we aim to empower individuals and businesses to fully incorporate Bitcoin into their operations and take advantage of the benefits it offers. Additionally, by providing access to CryptoWorkspace and hardware [1], we aim to make the process more accessible and efficient, allowing participants to focus on building and running their businesses rather than on technical challenges.

### Expected Final Product

The main objective of the Hack-Case for STAAT 2023 is to empower participants to build and manage their own company fully incorporating Bitcoin as a payment method. This includes not only using Bitcoin to pay for products and services from clients, but also for loans, employee payments, and fund raising. In addition, the process of setting up the company itself should be completed using Bitcoin. By completing this challenge, participants will not only gain a deeper understanding of how to use Bitcoin for business purposes, but also how to fully integrate it into their company's operations. This will give them a competitive advantage in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based businesses.

### Data

The participants in the Hack-Case will have access to a full Bitcoin blockchain, which will be provided to them to save time on syncing the blockchain. They will also be using laptops provided by the organizers and will have access to the CryptoWorkspace platform to verify their results. Additionally, they will be using open-source Bitcoin tools of their choice and will be working on their own Bitcoin infrastructure to incorporate it into their business operations. The challenge will also involve using various data related to Bitcoin transactions, such as transaction lookups and CSV exports, as well as metadata to ensure proper accounting of all transactions.

### Technology

The participants in the Hack-Case will have the freedom to choose any open-source Bitcoin tools that they are comfortable with. And are guided by Bitcoin professionals thouout the Hack-Case. They will also have access to a full Bitcoin blockchain, which will be provided to them to save time on syncing the blockchain. In addition, they will be using laptops provided by the organizers, and will have access to the CryptoWorkspace platform to verify their results. The technology stack will be centered around Bitcoin and will include tools such as Bitcoin nodes, Bitcoin explorers, Bitcoin payment servers, and Bitcoin wallets. Overall, the Hack-Case is designed to give participants a hands-on experience of building their own Bitcoin infrastructure and incorporating it into their business operations.

### Use Case (and Business Case)

Based on the given information, the users of the final product will likely be entrepreneurs and start-up companies who want to incorporate Bitcoin into their business operations. The goal of the Hack-Case is to enable participants to build their own Bitcoin infrastructure and use it to manage their company's finances, including payments to clients, loans, and employee salaries.

The participants are not necessarily required to come up with a specific use case, as the Hack-Case is designed to be flexible enough for participants to tailor it to their own business needs. However, the challenges presented in the Hack-Case are meant to simulate real-world scenarios that entrepreneurs and start-ups may encounter when using Bitcoin in their business operations. Overall, the Hack-Case is meant to provide participants with the knowledge and tools necessary to build and manage their own Bitcoin-based business from start to finish, with a focus on security and efficiency.

We need onboarding with a crypto exchange because participants will require Bitcoin to complete the challenges and transactions involved in the Hack-Case. A crypto exchange allows participants to purchase and sell Bitcoin for fiat currency, in this case, Swiss Francs. Onboarding with the exchange ensures that participants meet the necessary regulatory requirements and have the necessary documentation to participate in the exchange's services. It also helps prevent fraudulent activities and ensures that the transactions are conducted in a secure and compliant manner.
